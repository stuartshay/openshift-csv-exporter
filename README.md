# OpenShift CSV Exporter

A small collection of Bash scripts to export common OpenShift cluster information to timestamped CSV files.

## What it does

These scripts use `oc` and `jq` to collect cluster data and write CSV reports into the `output/` directory.

Each output file is named with a timestamp in this format:

`yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm`

Example:

`output/clusteroperators-2026-03-12-09-15.csv`

## Included reports

- `clusterrolebindings` — all ClusterRoleBinding subjects
- `clusterrolebinding self-provisioners` — self-provisioner binding
- `cluster-admin-bindings` — subjects with cluster-admin access
- `clusterroles` — ClusterRole permission rules
- `clusterversion` — cluster version and update status
- `clusteroperators` — cluster operator health
- `oauth cluster` — OAuth configuration summary
- `oauth external auth` — external authentication enforcement
- `infrastructure cluster` — platform and topology
- `apiserver console access` — API server and console security config
- `scc privileged` — privileged SecurityContextConstraints

See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for full column details and usage.

## Requirements

- Bash (or Git Bash on Windows)
- `oc` CLI already authenticated to the target cluster
- `jq`

Check prerequisites:

```bash
oc whoami
jq --version
```

## Quick start

Run the setup script to install dev tools and set permissions:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Run all reports:

```bash
./run-all.sh
```

Run a single report:

```bash
./scripts/export-clusteroperators.sh
```

## Output location

All CSV files are written to:

```bash
./output
```

The directory is created automatically if it does not exist.

## Notes

- Some commands require elevated cluster permissions.
- If one report fails while others succeed, that is usually an RBAC issue.
- For CSV export, `jq` is generally more reliable than trying to flatten YAML or `describe` text directly.

## Suggested repo layout

This package is already structured well for a starter GitHub repo:

```text
openshift-csv-exporter/
├── README.md
├── run-all.sh
├── scripts/
│   ├── common.sh
│   ├── export-clusteroperators.sh
│   ├── export-clusterrolebindings.sh
│   ├── export-clusterrolebinding-self-provisioners.sh
│   ├── export-clusterversion.sh
│   ├── export-infrastructure-cluster.sh
│   ├── export-oauth-cluster.sh
│   └── export-scc-privileged.sh
└── output/
```

## Next sensible improvements

A better long-term approach is usually one of these:

1. Keep separate scripts, but share common helper functions, which this package already does.
2. Add a single parameterized wrapper like `./run-report.sh clusteroperators`.
3. Add CI checks with `shellcheck`.
4. Add more exports for namespaces, pods, quotas, and deployments.

For a first GitHub repo, this package is a solid starting point.
